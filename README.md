# Weather-app
Created a weather app using Openweathermap API to fetch the weather details.
Fetched Weather Data from the rapid API. This endpoint returns a search result based on a location.
It also shows humidity,temperature,wind speed etc.
Created a UI and feed it by data from OpenWeatherMap.
Added Responsiveness by using Media Queries.

Also, I have hosted my app on Netlify
